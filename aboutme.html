        <p>
            <img src="images/pro.png" alt="displaypic"><br><br><br>I am going to try to keep this short, but I tend to
            ramble on and on, so feel free to stop reading at any point. My name is right on the top and I am 23 years
            old. I am finishing up my 3rd semester of computer programming at Fanshawe college, it has been an intense
            year of drinking coffee at 2 am and blaming the programming language when my program does not run. But, I am
            surviving. I am an ardent supporter of the Barcelona Soccer team. So when I am not coding, you will find me
            watching soccer or playing fifa.(If you can beat me on Fifa, then you already a legend). Moreover, I am a
            self-proclaimed photographer and I have a passion to travel. I was travelling and working in the west before
            I joined Fanshawe and it helped me to find what I really wanted to do in the future. Between, did I forget
            to mention I love memes? <br>But hey, thanks for reading the whole paragraph just about me and nice to meet
            you.

        <h2>Why programming?</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="images/Question-mark.png" alt="question">Ever since I watched Breaking Bad I wanted to be a
            Chemist (Just kidding), but let us be realistic here. I have always been fascinated by technologies and
            numbers. When I was a kid I always wondered how traffic lights and ATMs works, and how terribly these can go
            wrong if it does not function as it supposed to. My passion and curiosity towards technology lead me towards
            programming. It was the right decision!! I am loving it. Fanshawe gave me a strong foundation about the
            programming concepts. I found some of the projects very intense and time-consuming, but I am enjoying these
            challenges. I am just overwhelmed by the fact that there is so much to learn and I am totally fine with
            that.

        <h2>What is my goal?</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="images/goal.png" alt="goal"><br><br><br><br>I believe every day is a new opportunity. My primary
            goal always remains the same, keep improving myself personally and professionally. My short-term goal is to
            secure a co-op position at a company where I can continue to learn about the industry and apply the skills I
            already know.<br>I am comparatively new to programming, but I have learned a lot over the year and I am very
            passionate about what I am doing. So if you are looking for someone upbeat and excited then you are in the
            right place.
